_PhD candidate plant physiology and junior teacher at the molecular plant physiology group of Utrecht University_


Welcome again to my portfolio page! 
Here, I keep a record of my academic and educational projects, and some personal ones too. 
Academically, I'm a biologist first, yet also a generalist with added experience in computer science and an affinity for physics. 
My free time is spent tinkering with electronics, climbing boulders, or practising scuba diving. 
If it's sunny outside, I like to go out on my longboard, photograph the beautiful city of Utrecht, or go sailing.
Friends appreciate (or dread at times) my never-fading enthusiasm for puns, so consider yourself warned. 
In my work, and as a plant biologist specifically, I want to do the science we need for a sustainable future. 
What the future holds exactly, I don't know. 
But recently, I started dreaming an old dream again: a kids' dream of becomming an astronaut. 
In 2021, I applied to the ESA programme, and since then, I'd love for nothing more than to combine my skills and develop further as an ESA astronaut.

# Me besides the Science

One of my hobbies I'd like to showcase here, is photography.
I usually photograph the city of Utrecht, just because it's so photogenic and well, I live here! 
Find out more on my [instagram page](https://instagram.com/laura_in_utrecht). 
Additionally, I like shooting landscapes and macros of plants. 
Some example plictures are available [here](/photograph)
Most of the photos here are made by myself, and most photo's of me are made by my lovely girlfriend with whom I share this fun hobby.

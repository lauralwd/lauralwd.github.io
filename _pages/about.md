One of my hobbies I'd like to showcase here, is photography.
I usually photograph the city of Utrecht, just because it's so photogenic and well, I live here!
Find out more on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/laura_in_utrecht) or go to my photography page via the button below.
Additionally, I like shooting landscapes and macros of plants.
Most of the photos here are made by myself, and most photo's of me are made by my lovely girlfriend with whom I share this fun hobby.
Some example pictures are available here:

Besides photography, you can find my climbing or bouldering every week and in the summer I love sailing on the family's traditional Dutch sailing boat.
Some weekend, it's good to take it easy, in which case you can find me in our lovely garden tending to the plants.

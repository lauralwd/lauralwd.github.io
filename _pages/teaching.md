Being a junior teacher for 28% of my contract time, I stand in front of many classes.
These classes sometimes are filled with first-year students on their first day, other times with experienced Master's students learning the details of a certain technique, and many levels of students in between.
During my work at Utrecht University, I have grown from practical assistant to coordinator of my own Master's course.
In my teaching practice, I find it important that academic students experience and execute a certain experiment or technique rather than just reading about it.
University is explicitly a place where students should be embeded in research practice, especially in the later stage of their academic education.
While gaining practical experience, I support students in maintaining oversight over what and why they are doing what they are doing.
For those who are interested, a draft of my application for the University Teaching Qualification (UTQ) or BKO in Dutch, is available [here](/teaching/BKO/).
This document is written in Dutch completely.

Finally, perhaps also have a look at my [outreach projects](/outreach/){: .btn .btn--info}

## Assisting teacher
Experience as an assistant teacher in courses such as 'systems biology' (1st year BSc), 'plant physiology' and 'molecular genetic research techniques' (2nd year BSc).

## Teacher
Experience as a teacher in courses 'biology of the bio-based economy' (3rd year BSc) and 'introduction to bioinformatics for life sciences' (1st Year MSc).

## Course coordinator
After being a teacher for several editions, I took it upon myself to coordinate the entire 'introduction to bioinformatics for life sciences' course. 
As coordinator, I manage and organise a team of experts from various local institutions with whom I build one consistent course. 
Students are introduced to many subfields of bioinformatics by absolute experts. 
I guide and supervise the students during the whole course and the many hands-on exercises. 
As coordinator, I guard cohesion between the many parts and people involved.
One section of the course is completely of my own design and I chose the share this publicly on github: a hands-on session for learning metagenomics.
Read more about this on the [practical home page](https://www.lauradijkhuizen.com/metagenomicspractical).

## Tutor
Being employed as a part-time teacher, I also tutor students. 
First, I tutor Bachelor's students from their first day of university until they finish their Bachelor's. 
Second, I tutor and guide students during their internships in our Azolla lab at Utrecht University. 
These students can be bachelor students, experienced Master's students, or non-academic students.

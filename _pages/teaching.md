Being a junior teacher for 28% of my contract time, I stand in front of many classes.
These classes sometimes are filled with first-year students on their first day, other times with experienced Master's students learning the details of a certain technique, and many levels of students in between. 
During my work at Utrecht University, I have grown from practical assistant to coordinator of my own Master's course. 
In my teaching practice, I find it important that academic students experience and do a certain experiment or technique, rather than just reading about it. 
Whenever I can, I implement this in my teaching.

Perhaps also have a look at my [outreach projects](/outreach/).

## Assisting teacher
Experience as an assistant teacher in courses such as 'systems biology' (1st year BSc), 'plant physiology' and 'molecular genetic research techniques' (2nd year BSc).

## Teaching
Experience as a teacher in courses 'biology of the bio-based economy' (3rd year BSc) and 'introduction to bioinformatics for life sciences' (1st Year MSc).

## Course coordinator
After being a teacher for several editions, I took it upon myself to coordinate the entire 'introduction to bioinformatics for life sciences' course. 
As coordinator, I manage and organise a team of experts from various local institutions with whom I build one consistent course. 
Students are introduced to many subfields of bioinformatics by absolute experts. 
I guide and supervise the students during the whole course and the many hands-on exercises. 
As coordinator, I guard cohesion between the many parts and people involved.

## Tutor
Being employed as a part-time teacher, I also tutor students. 
First, I tutor Bachelor's students from their first day of university until they finish their Bachelor's. 
Second, I tutor and guide students during their internships in our Azolla lab at Utrecht University. 
These students can be bachelor students, experienced Master's students, or non-academic students.

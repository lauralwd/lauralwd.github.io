Welcome to my portfolio page! 
Here, I keep a record of my adacemic and educational projects, and some personal ones too. 
Academically, I'm a biologist first, yet also a generalist with added experience in computer science and an affinity for physics. 
The Open Science school of thought strongly speaks to me, so I try hard to implement OS in my work as good as I can.
My free time is spent tinkering with electronics, climbing boulders, or practising scuba diving. 
If it's sunny outside, I like to go out on my longboard, photograph the beautiful city of Utrecht, or go sailing.
Friends appreciate (or dread at times) my never-fading enthusiasm for puns, so consider yourself warned. 
In my work, and as a plant biologist specifically, I want to do the science we need for a sustainable future. 
What the future holds exactly, I dont know. 
But recently, I started dreaming an old dream again: a kids' dream of becomming an astronaut. 
In 2021, I aplied to the ESA programme and since then I'd love for nothing more than to combine my skills and develop further as an ESA astronaut.

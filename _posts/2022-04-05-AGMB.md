# Azolla genus-wide metagenome taxonomy browser
For my project on the _Azolla_ genus-wide metagenome, I wanted to simultaneously visualise many metagenome assemblies.
<!--more-->
The visualisation should allow assessing (dis)similarities amongst the species' metagenomes.
The resulting figure is an interactive R shiny app.
This app takes multiple metagenome assemblies classified by [CAT](https://github.com/dutilh/CAT) and plots the contigs by length, depth and taxonomy.
The colours represent the approximate taxonomy of anyone contig.
I included some filters to remove any noise from the taxonomies assessed, as well as tools to zoom in on specific regions.
Have fun exploring the _Azolla_ genus metagenome:

The app takes a couple of seconds to load so please be patient.
For a full-screen-display of the figure, go to it's [dedicated page](https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/Azolla_genus-wide_metagenome_taxonomy/). 
Alternativelly, read more about my [science projects](/science/).
